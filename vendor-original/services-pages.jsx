          <p>At Pawpad, sessions begin with a slow conversation. We watch how your dog moves, where they're guarding, what they're avoiding. We then use trigger-point release, fascial work, and gentle range-of-motion techniques to help the body let go of what it's been holding.</p>
          <p>Most dogs visibly soften within the first session. Recovery cases — post-surgery, post-injury, or chronic compensation patterns — often see meaningful change over 3–5 sessions.</p>
