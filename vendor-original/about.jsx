  "I always wanted to work with animals. I just took the long way to get here...",
  "For a long time, I was looking for something and didn't quite know what. I taught dance. I ran a clothing store. I got married and moved to London, where I worked at a bridal shop. Each thing was fine. None of it felt like mine.",
  "I grew up loving animals but had talked myself out of that path early — I was terrible at science, the formal routes felt out of reach, and so the dream stayed quietly in the background while I tried other things.",
  "Every morning on the way to work in London, I walked past a pet grooming studio. I'd slow down without meaning to, just watching the animals inside, the way someone was caring for them. Something about it stayed with me. I didn't do anything about it then. I just kept walking.",
  "I came back to Bangalore pregnant with my son, and somewhere between the anticipation of a new baby and the uncertainty of what came next, that old feeling returned — the one from the London window. When my son was a little older and started going to Green Pocket, I noticed a boarding space right next door called Petstepin. I walked in one afternoon. And that was that.",
  "I reached out to Ashita Mathew at Wags and Wiggles to do my certification. Balak, my husband, paid for the course without hesitation. He believed this was worth doing before I had fully convinced myself of it. When I was ready to start Pawpad in 2015, he funded that too. There would be no Pawpad without him, and I want to say that plainly.",
  "It was at Wags and Wiggles that I first met Sindhoor Pangal. She ran her dog behaviour practice from the studio above — and what began as proximity became something much more important. Sindhoor became a mentor. Not just in the technical sense, but in the deeper one — the kind of mentor who makes space for your fears, who lets you speak the things you're not sure of yet, and who doesn't rush you past the uncertainty. Her thinking on animal behaviour and what dogs are actually communicating has shaped how I see every single animal that comes through Pawpad's door.",
  "That relationship has continued. I went on to study Canine 101 with BHARCS — Sindhoor's organisation — and the community there has become genuinely important to me. These are people who take animal psychology seriously, who are always learning, and who hold each other to a standard of care that I find both challenging and grounding.",
  "I spent two years working at Cessna before going out on my own — learning not just technique, but how to read an animal. How to tell the difference between a dog that's coping and one that's shutting down. How to make the whole experience feel less like something being done to them.",

          <p>I have always had a deep connection with India's streeties. They live on the edges. Unloved by most, uncared for, existing just outside the boundary of where belonging is granted. And yet there is so much in them — such freedom, such joy in small things, such depth of feeling — that anyone who stops long enough to really look is met with a whirlwind of warmth and life.</p>
          <p>I see myself in them. I know what it is to live a little outside, to carry more than people assume, to light up completely when someone finally takes the time to see you. That recognition is part of why I do this work. Every animal deserves someone who stops. Who looks. Who stays.</p>

We also run grooming courses and work with rescues.

            <p className="lead">At Pawpad, we believe grooming is about far more than appearance. It is about comfort, trust, emotional wellbeing, and creating positive experiences that help pets feel safe in our care.</p>
            <p>Every animal is different. Some arrive curious and confident, while others may be anxious, sensitive, elderly, rescued, or completely new to grooming. Rather than following a fixed approach, we adapt each session to the individual animal in front of us — their temperament, coat condition, physical comfort, and emotional state.</p>
            <p>Our philosophy is rooted in listening. Dogs and cats communicate constantly through their body language, behaviour, and responses to handling. We pay close attention to these signals and adjust our pace accordingly. Sometimes that means taking extra time. Sometimes it means giving a pet a break. And sometimes it means doing less in a session so that trust can be built over time.</p>
            <p>We do not believe in rushed grooming, force-based handling, or prioritising cosmetic results over an animal's wellbeing. Instead, we focus on creating calm, low-stress experiences that support healthy skin, coat maintenance, hygiene, mobility, and emotional comfort.</p>
            <p>Years of working with pets, rescue animals, and community animals have reinforced one simple belief: every animal deserves to be treated with patience, compassion, and respect. That belief guides every decision we make, from the way appointments are scheduled to the way pets are handled throughout their visit.</p>
            <p>For us, successful grooming is not just about how a pet looks when they leave. It is about how they feel, and whether they leave more comfortable, more confident, and more willing to return the next time.</p>
